Ye call Me Master and obey me not,  
Ye call Me Light and see Me not,  
Ye call Me Way and walk not,  
Ye call Me Life and desire Me not,  
Ye call Me wise and follow Me not,  
Ye call Me fair and love Me not,  
Ye call Me rich and ask Me not,  
Ye call Me eternal and seek Me not,  
Ye call Me gracious and trust Me not,  
Ye call Me noble and serve Me not,  
Ye call Me mighty and honor Me not,  
Ye call Me just and fear Me not,  
If I condemn you, blame me not.
