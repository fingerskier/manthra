# More Lengths Stuffs

Men are qualified for civil liberty in exact proportion to their disposition to put moral chains upon their own appetites.
Society cannot exist unless a controlling power is put somewhere on will and appetite, and the less of it there is within, the more there must be without.
It is ordained in the eternal constitution of things that men of intemperate minds cannot be free.
Their passions forge their fetters.
Err, then, and err again, but less and less and less, till the very worst fault becomes tolerable.
  Edward Burke  
  

Children's Logic:  
"Give me a sentence about a public servant," said a teacher. 
The small boy wrote: "The fireman came down the ladder pregnant." The teacher took the lad aside to correct him. 
"Don't you know what pregnant means?" she asked. 
"Sure," said the young boy confidently. "It means carrying a child."
