Quote from SG-1 episode Heroes 2; by Emmett Bregman portrayed by Saul Rubinek


Why is that camera off? 
You don't know what you're doing here ... maybe I know what I'm doing here. 
These people are risking there lives for us.

  I want to see what they're going through even if they don't want us to and I want other people to see it. 
What do you think they're doing out there ... protecting and defending secrecy! 
That's the world of Mao and Stalin and secret police, secret trials, secret deaths. 

  You force the press into the cold and all you will get is lies and innuendo and nothing. 
Nothing is worse for a free society than a press that is in service to the military and the politicians. 
Nothing. 

  You turn that camera off when I tell you to turn it off. 
You think I give a damn what you think about me? 
You serve the people ... so do I!
