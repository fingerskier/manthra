2025 Global Politics in A Nutshell

500 million Europeans are asking 300 million Americans to protect them from 140 million Russians.
Meanwhile, 1 billion Muslims are seeking the repression of 10 million Jews.

Wars are not fought to regain peace, not even for resources;
but to prop up power centers. 

The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
All the while the travesties that made US founders demand the Bill of Rights are lauded as the way of progress. 

Godless and broken we shake our fists at heaven and eschew the raw materiel necessary for our redemption.
The answer to the ills of humanity is creation. 
Not only are we not creating new life and prosperity, we are destroying it.
Worse, these destructions are the cultic practices of the world.

The answer is clear but not easy. 
The way is straight but hard.
When the government's boot is on your neck, whether it's the left or the right doesn't matter.
Shove off the boot, stand and make.
