If charity's only cause is chemical elation, for the normal human, then it varies not at all from the chemical elation a twisted killer gets from murder.
But there is a difference in the two and that main difference is cannot be internal (if the cause & effect is chemical/physical.)
So, where does it come from?
We can obfuscate and push it off to unknowns or accept what millenia of humanity has come to discover and _prove_- that there is an intelligent entity with a vested interest in our future who inteeracts with our world to whatever extent we desire.
