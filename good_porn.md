Why does a rabbi own PornHub?

  Solomon Friedman is the new owner of PornHub.
He is a Jewish attorney and rabbi.
His private equity firm took over Mindgeek, the umbrella company of many porn sites.
He vowed to save PornHub from ruin and make it a better place.
But how?

  PornHub is used to post sex videos.
These include some where minors are raped by adult men.
Besides the obvious evils of pedophilia, the site can only do evil, whether both parties consent or not.

  So what did rabbi Friedman mean by his usage of "good"?
Before PornHub came under fire for profiting off rape videos, anyone could post a video.
Under Friedman's watch, users are now required to be verified and much of the illegal content was removed.
Seems right right?

  PornHub hired hundreds of in-house moderators to view the porn before it goes live.
But who verifies these moderators?
Imagine spending an entire workweek "verifying" sex videos.
What kind of person does that?

Likely not a person concerned with it's immorality or someone aware of the dangers of porn:

* Eviscerated dopamine receptors.
* A skewed reality of sexual relations.
* Social isolation.
* Emotional numbness, sociopathy.
* Fantasy world-view.

  Essentially nothing will change under the new management.
It seems to be just damage control.
It is pretending to be more humane for the public so MindGeek can continue damaging the cultural fabric of society without scrutiny.

  MindGeek has actually developed a very sophisticated technology to detect illegal videos.
Their algorithm to keep users hooked is equally sophisticated.
They're more of a software company than a porn business.
Match that with the allure of the content itself and we have a recipe for incredible influence.

  Much like abortion and usury, porn is a sacrament to the nominal believer.
The nascent belief yields to, and blends with, culture to become a base of power.
That power is wielded to establish the life that _we_ want.

  Whatever Scripture forbids, interpretation permits.
This is the religious mindset and it permeates Christian, Jewish, and Muslim society.
It is consistent with the religious leadership who killed Christ 2000 years ago.
It is the foundation on which ungodly theocracies are built.
