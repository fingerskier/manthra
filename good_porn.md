PornHub hired hundreds of in-house moderators to view the porn before it goes live.
But who verifies these moderators?
Imagine spending an entire workweek "verifying" sex videos.
What kind of person does that?

Likely not a person concerned with it's immorality or someone aware of the dangers of porn:

* Eviscerated dopamine receptors.
* A skewed reality of sexual relations.
* Social isolation.
* Emotional numbness, sociopathy.
* Fantasy world-view.

MindGeek, the parent company of PornHub, has also developed a very sophisticated technology to detect illegal videos.
Their algorithm to keep users hooked is equally sophisticated.
They're more of a software company than a porn business.
Match that with the allure of the content itself and we have a recipe for incredible influence.

But the bucket of content they are filtering still contains those items deemed _too gross_ for nominal consumption.
The moderators and the AI/tech still see all of the content.

Much like abortion and usury, porn is a sacrament to the nominal believer.
The nascent desires blend with belief and culture to become a base of power.
That power is wielded to establish the life that _we_ want.

Whatever Scripture forbids, interpretation permits.
This is the religious mindset and it permeates Christian, Jewish, and Muslim society.
It is consistent with the religious leadership who killed Christ 2000 years ago.
It is the foundation on which ungodly theocracies are built.
