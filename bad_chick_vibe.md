You know what annoys me lately?
It's all this _boss bitch_, _bad girl_ energy vibe.
Hold on for a second, Missus.
Don't be gettin your knickers in a twist.
They make out that men and women are the same.
That we have the potential to do the same things and reach the same heights as men.
No, we don't.
We are equal but we're not the same.
We need more fat than men.
We need more sleep than men.
We're not as stress resilient as men.
We have a 28-day cycle while men have a 24-hour cycle.
..lucky bastards.

You sleep in a house that was built by men.
You drive in car on a road that was built by men.
Society would not be able to function without men.
...but without women there would be no men and no society.
Rather than seeing each other as competition we complement each other.
That's what makes the relationship between the two so beautiful.

Remember, the next time you look down on men as if they're shit on your shoe:
all the hard work your father, or grandfather, or great-grandfather has gone through to build the society you live in.
