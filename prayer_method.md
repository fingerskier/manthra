# Prayer Method

Consider prayer as a list of things to-do.
Of course: your actual to-dos should be on the list.

You present the list to the The Boss.
He gets to pick the one's he will handle.
Those that are urgent, and can only be done _by Him_, He will handle immediately.
Those that are not urgent, but can only be done _by Him_, He will schedule for later.
Everything else gets delegated to _someone_.

Of the remaining items- the one's that are urgent should be done **right now** (yes now!).
For the rest of the items- the one's that are still important get scheduled for later.
Everything else goes in the bin:
not that its not important- just not for you.
