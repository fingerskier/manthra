You see this goblet?  For me this glass is already broken.
I enjoy it; I drink out of it; It holds my water admirably, sometimes even reflecting the sun in beautiful patterns.
If I should tap it, it has a lovely ring to it. But when I put this glass on the shelf and the wind knocks it over or my elbow brushes it off the table and it falls to the ground and shatters, or it simply breaks over time, I say, ‘Of course.’
When I understand that the glass is already broken, every moment with it is precious.
