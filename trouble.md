A bird was flying when a sudden cold storm came up and froze it's wings. 
It fell to the ground.
Along came a cow who pooped on the bird.
The poop thawed the bird and kept it warm. 
The bird was so happy that it cried out loudly. 
Along came a cat who ate the bird alive.

Not everyone who shits on you is your enemy. 
Not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend. 
When you're in deep shit, keep your mouth shut.
