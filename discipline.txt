Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge, but whoever hates correction is stupid.

Like a city whose walls are broken through is a person who lacks self-control.

No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it.

I strike a blow to my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified for the prize.

For the Spirit God gave us does not make us timid, but gives us power, love and self-discipline.

Blessed is the one whom God corrects; so do not despise the discipline of the Almighty. For he wounds, but he also binds up; he injures, but his hands also heal.

Do not despise the Lord's discipline, and do not resent his rebuke, because the Lord disciplines those he loves, as a father the son he delights in.
